# ============ External Folder Endpoints ============

# GHSA-r2qv follow-up (audit finding I1): external-folder mount path uses an
# allowlist of operator-opted-in roots rather than the original denylist of
# system directories. The denylist shape was fail-open-on-growth — anything
# not enumerated (``/data`` containing other users' archives, ``/root``,
# arbitrary NFS/SMB mounts, the Bambuddy ``LOG_DIR``) could be mounted by any
# user with ``LIBRARY_UPLOAD``. The allowlist defaults to empty and is
# extended via the ``BAMBUDDY_EXTERNAL_ROOTS`` env var (colon-separated
# absolute paths). The route is additionally gated on ``SETTINGS_UPDATE``
# (admin scope) rather than ``LIBRARY_UPLOAD`` because mounting host paths
# is an operator-level capability that crosses user boundaries.


# Bambuddy-owned data directories. Hardcode-rejected even if the operator
# tries to add them to ``BAMBUDDY_EXTERNAL_ROOTS`` — mounting these would
# allow reading other users' archives, log files, or the static assets path.

    Args:

        project_id: Return all files across folders linked to this project (bulk fetch, avoids N+1).
        include_root: If True and folder_id is None, returns files at root level.
                     If False and folder_id is None, returns all files.
        internal_only: Restrict the result to files in managed storage (`is_external=False`).
                       Used by the File Manager's "All Files" sidebar entry so a linked NAS
                       with hundreds of files doesn't drown the user's own uploads (#1621).
        external_only: Restrict the result to files under external folders
                       (`is_external=True`) — the symmetric combined view for users with
                       multiple linked external sources (#1621).
        recursive: When combined with ``folder_id``, also include files in every
                   descendant subfolder (#1268). Implemented via a recursive CTE
                   that walks ``library_folders.parent_id``. Default off so
                   existing callers (folder browsing, etc.) keep their narrow
                   single-folder semantics.
        tag_ids: Restrict the listing to files carrying ALL of these tags
                 (AND semantics, #1268). When non-empty the folder filter is
                 intentionally bypassed — tags are cross-cutting and the user
                 wants "every file with this tag" regardless of where it lives.
                 ``recursive`` becomes irrelevant in that case.
