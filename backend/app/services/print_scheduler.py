        completion meant for something else (the printer's own
        ``auto_pa_line_calib_mode`` run, say) cannot end someone's job early.
        The refusal has no way back, though: nothing else ever closes the row,
        and ``check_queue`` treats every ``printing`` row as a busy printer, so
        one bad comparison wedges that printer's queue until a human presses
        cancel. That is what #2829's reporters hit, and the guard's own
        docstring already called stranding the worse of the two failures.

        This is the way back. When a row has been ``printing`` while its
        printer sat in a terminal state for the whole grace period, the print
        is over however the event was read, and the row is closed with the
        status the printer's own state implies.

        Deliberately conservative:

        * Only a connected printer counts. A disconnected one has a stale
          ``state`` and proves nothing.
        * The clock is reset by any non-terminal observation, so this cannot
          fire on a printer that is merely between stages.
        * The grace period is far longer than the gap between a printer
          finishing and its completion arriving, so the normal path always
          wins the race and this only ever sees genuine strandings.

        What it does *not* do is replay the completion's side effects --
        notifications, billing, auto-off. It restores the queue, which is the
        harm being undone; the archive was updated by the normal path
        regardless, since only the queue block refuses. A recovery that

        A claim is only ever held by a live dispatch coroutine, so when this

        is stale. At startup that is trivially true — no coroutine survives a
        restart. It is equally true on any later tick where no upload is running,
        which is what makes this safe to repeat rather than only run once.

        Repeating it matters because ``_clear_dispatch_claim`` is best-effort: if
        the database is briefly unreachable at exactly the moment dispatch ends,
        the claim survives and the row is wedged out of the selection query. That
        used to last until the next restart (#2702 follow-up, seen when
        PostgreSQL refused a connection mid-dispatch).

        ``_inflight`` is populated when the task is spawned, before the coroutine
        claims its row, and pruned by a done-callback that cannot run before the
        coroutine's own ``finally`` — so "claim present, nothing in flight" has no
        race window and needs no age threshold. A size-derived upload deadline
        (``max(600s, size/25KB/s)``) has no safe fixed bound anyway.

        Dispatch used to happen inline in the selection loop: ``await
        _start_print(db, item)`` per item in turn. Since ``_start_print``
        performs the FTP upload, that serialized every printer behind every
        other printer's transfer even though the printers are independent
        machines; #2555 moved it to a parallel ``asyncio.gather()``. But that
        gather was awaited before ``check_queue`` returned, so the run loop
        stayed blocked until the *slowest* upload in the batch finished — a
        513 s upload left 15 of 16 configured slots idle for 8.5 minutes on a
        93-printer farm even as other printers came free (#2602).

        Each upload now runs as an independent background task tracked in
        ``self._inflight``. check_queue excludes in-flight item_ids (still
        `pending` until their upload completes) and their printers from the
        next pass's selection, and this method launches at most
        ``limit - len(self._inflight)`` new uploads, so a freed slot refills on
        the next fast tick instead of waiting out the whole batch. The bound
        exists because the printers are independent but the host is not: each
        in-flight upload holds a thread in the FTP pool, a TLS session and a
        file handle.

        The no-overlapping-dispatch invariant the batch-await used to provide
        is now carried by the in-flight exclusion in check_queue. Everything
        else — the pending->printing CAS, the busy-printer guard (#2598), the
        per-printer hold, and each item's independent failure handling — still
        lives in ``_start_print`` and runs per task exactly as before.

        Synchronous on purpose: it registers every launched task into
        ``self._inflight`` before returning, so the next (sequential) tick sees
        an accurate in-flight count with no interleaving await.

        RFID-decremented value, which has two limitations the "Prefer Lowest

        - it's only meaningful for Bambu RFID spools; everything else reports

          compare equal and the sort collapses to AMS-slot order — the user

          of the lower-remaining pick;

          ``remaining_weight`` (Spoolman mode) — the two diverge any time the
          user re-spools, swaps cardboard, or runs a print outside Bambuddy.

        When the user has bound a spool to a slot, their own inventory
        tracking is authoritative; this helper surfaces that value so the
        sort can prefer it. Slots without a binding are absent from the
        returned map — the caller then falls back to MQTT ``remain`` for
        those, preserving the pre-#1508 behaviour for un-tracked spools.

        Returns an empty map on any failure (no inventory bindings, DB

        whose feature was disabled mid-hold gets its bed released.

        Printers being dispatched this tick are excluded from the bed-off
        publish: ``_preheat_and_soak`` owns the bed from that tick on, so a
        transient 0 in between would just churn against preheat. Ownership of
        the hot bed transfers to the preheat rollback pin instead — if the
        dispatch aborts before the print starts (failed upload, cancelled
        item), `_rollback_preheat_pin` turns the bed off; if preheat itself
        skips (e.g. the item has no bed_temperature metadata) the pin entry
        is the ONLY thing standing between an aborted dispatch and a bed
        left hot with no owner. A successful print start clears the pin and
        the print's own gcode takes over, as usual.

        When a printer just finished a job (FINISH state) and the next queued
        item needs chamber heating, hold the bed hot so the chamber stays warm
        during the bed-clearing window. The bed is the chamber's heating
        element here, not a print surface — nothing is printing during the
        hold and the dispatched print's own preheat/gcode re-targets the bed —
        so the hold temperature is ``queue_keep_warm_bed_temp`` (default 90°C,
        chosen to sustain chamber warmth and to satisfy bed-threshold-linked
        aftermarket chamber heaters), raised to the item's own parsed
        bed_temperature when that is higher. Items whose archive metadata has
        no bed temperature (e.g. OrcaSlicer gcode.3mf exports) therefore still
        get a hold — chamber need is what gates the feature, not metadata.
        Skips entirely for filaments that map to a 0°C chamber target
        (PLA, PETG, etc.). Printers being dispatched this cycle are excluded:
        ``_preheat_and_soak`` already handles their bed temperature.

        Bounded by ``queue_keep_warm_max_minutes`` — on timeout the bed is
        released to 0 and the entry is latched ``expired=True`` so
        subsequent ticks neither re-engage nor re-seed the clock. Idempotent
        MQTT: publish is skipped when firmware already has the target.

        The release sweep runs BEFORE the engagement gate so a printer that

          3. Three hardware tiers branch the wait loop:
             - Chamber heater (H2C/H2D/H2DPro/H2S/X2D/X1E via supports_chamber_heater):
               send M141 to the resolved target, then wait for the chamber sensor
               to reach it (or the max-wait timeout to elapse).
             - Chamber sensor only (X1C/P2S via supports_chamber_temp ∧ ¬supports_chamber_heater):
               no M141; the bed is the only heat source, so we wait for the chamber
               sensor to rise via bed radiation OR fall through on timeout.
             - No chamber sensor (P1S/P1P/A1/A1 Mini): no way to verify chamber
               temperature; the function just heats the bed and holds for the
               configured soak duration.

        The bed target comes from the archive's parsed metadata
        (`bed_temperature`); if missing the preheat stage logs and returns
        without dispatching anything, rather than guessing at a default that
        might wreck filament setup.

        Failures are logged but never re-raised — preheat is best-effort. A
        printer that goes offline mid-soak, a refused gcode command, or a
        missing temperature reading must not turn into a failed queue item; the
        normal upload + start path runs immediately after this method returns.

        Queue creation happily puts that flag on every copy of a ``quantity > 1``
        request, and ``_clone_queue_item`` copies ``library_file_id`` onto batch
        clones, so the first dispatch could pull the file out from under rows that
        had not run yet. What those rows did next depended on the database, and
        neither answer was right: SQLite ships with ``PRAGMA foreign_keys`` off, so
        the ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` on ``print_queue.library_file_id`` never fired and
        they were left pointing at a row that no longer existed, failing with
        "Library file not found" whenever someone started them -- or sitting
        ``pending`` forever under ``manual_start``. PostgreSQL enforces the same
        constraint, so there the rows were deleted outright and the queued copies
        simply vanished, with no error and no history.

        The archive holds its own copy of the 3MF, so the remaining copies can print
        from it instead. Two things happen here, and both must happen *before* the

          counts its progress from.

        Bambuddy optimistically marks the queue item as "printing" right after the
        MQTT project_file publish succeeds locally. The watchdog runs in two phases:

        Phase A (up to ``timeout``): wait for either an active-state transition
        or a ``subtask_id`` advance past ``pre_subtask_id``. State alone is the
        primary signal; subtask_id advance handles the H2D case where state can
        sit at FINISH for ~50 s after the printer accepted ``project_file``
        before flipping to PREPARE (#1078). If neither happens, the MQTT publish
        was lost on a half-broken session (#887/#936) — revert and force
        reconnect (the #967 recovery path).

        Phase B (up to ``phase_b_timeout``, only if Phase A exited on subtask_id
        alone): keep watching for the active-state transition. subtask_id alone
        proves the file landed but not that the printer started — and a printer
        that accepts the command but stays at IDLE/FINISH indefinitely (e.g.
        cloud+LAN re-auth dance after a power cycle on old firmware, #1678)
        used to leave the queue item stuck in 'printing' forever because the
        old watchdog returned success as soon as subtask_id advanced. If Phase
        B times out, revert the queue item so the user can retry without
        restarting Bambuddy. Skip ``force_reconnect`` here: the file landed and
        a forced reconnect mid-parse triggers 0500_4003 (#1150).

        Phase A timeout raised from 45 s → 90 s as belt-and-braces for slow
        transitions that also don't emit an early subtask_id tick.

        Both phases also watch for ``HMS_MQTT_VERIFY_FAILED``. A printer that
        refuses to verify our commands will never start this job or any other,
        so waiting out the full 270 s and re-uploading the 3MF twice more only
        burns an upload slot the rest of the farm is queued behind — that path
        is for a printer that might still come good, which this one cannot
        (#2732). It fails the item on the spot with the actual reason instead.
