"""Per-slice 3MF input normalisation for the slicer pipeline.

This module currently exposes one helper, :func:`substitute_unused_plate_filaments`,
which rewrites the user's filament list so unused-slot entries don't trip
BambuStudio's loaded-filament temperature validator. The original goal of
this module — a two-pass cross-nozzle-class config-splice (#1493) — was
replaced by a simpler approach: forwarding the sidecar's existing
``--arrange`` flag (see ``slicer_api.SlicerApiService.slice_with_profiles``
and ``_run_slicer_with_fallback`` in ``api/routes/library.py``). BambuStudio
itself reconciles the embedded ``project_settings.config`` against the
target printer when ``--arrange`` is on, so Bambuddy never has to reproduce
that schema logic locally.

    each plate independently against the target printer (BS CLI's
    ``--arrange`` is project-wide so a single ``--slice 0`` call would
    consolidate every plate's objects onto one bed — the bug this whole
    path exists to work around). Each input is a single-plate 3MF whose
    ``Metadata/plate_N.gcode`` / ``plate_N.json`` / ``plate_N.png``
    entries already carry the right plate index because the BS CLI
    preserves the requested plate number in the output filenames.

    The merge strategy:
    - The first plate's 3MF is the base — its ``project_settings.config``
      (target printer), ``3D/3dmodel.model``, and Auxiliaries images
      carry forward.
    - Per-plate artifacts from the other inputs (``plate_N.gcode``,
      ``plate_N.gcode.md5``, ``plate_N.json``, ``plate_N.png``,
      ``plate_N_small.png``, ``plate_no_light_N.png``, ``top_N.png``,
      ``pick_N.png``) are overlaid into the base.
    - ``slice_info.config`` is re-assembled from each input's single
      ``<plate>`` block so the resulting file lists all N plates.
    - ``source_3mf_bytes``, when supplied, is used as a fallback source
      of per-plate thumbnails (``plate_N.png`` and ``plate_N_small.png``)
      when the sliced outputs don't carry them — BS CLI with ``--arrange``
      regenerates the plate gcode but rarely writes a fresh per-plate

      a cover image for plate 1 (the base 3MF) and the archive page's

    """Replace any filament-list entry whose 1-indexed slot isn't used by
    ``plate_id`` with the entry from the plate's lowest *used* slot.

    Why: the slice modal lets the user pick a filament profile per slot,
    but each plate in a multi-plate project only uses a subset of those
    slots. The modal labels the unused rows "not used by this plate" yet
    still submits their dropdown values. BambuStudio then validates every
    loaded filament — for material compatibility (PLA in a used slot +
    ABS defaulted into an unused slot trips "the temperature difference
    of the filaments used is too large", exit 194) and for printer
    compatibility ("filament preset X (slot N) is not compatible with
    printer Y", exit -5) — even though the plate's G-code never touches
    the unused slot. Substituting unused entries with a used slot's
    filament keeps the per-filament array length intact (so the source
    3MF's per-slot references stay valid) while making the loaded set
    both materially homogeneous and printer-correct, so both validators
    pass.

    The anchor is the lowest used slot, NOT slot 1 (#2628). Slot 1 is
    itself unused on plenty of plates, and anchoring there did the two
    things this function exists to prevent: the substitution became a
    no-op for the slot that needed it most, and — with more than one
    unused slot — it propagated slot 1's own preset (in the reported
    case an ``@Bambu Lab H2D`` profile baked into the source 3MF) into
    every other unused slot, blocking an A1 slice on slots the plate
    doesn't even use.

    The substitution is a no-op when:
    - ``plate_id`` is not a real plate — ``None`` (caller couldn't say) or
      ``0`` (the slice-all sentinel, where every slot is used by *some*
      plate so there is nothing unused to substitute). Callers that know
      "absent means plate 1" must resolve that themselves before calling;
      this function will not guess, because guessing wrong rewrites a
      filament the plate actually prints with.
    - the source isn't a valid 3MF / zip,
    - the source doesn't carry plate-extruder metadata (parse returns
      empty set — treat as "every slot is used", same fallback the
      SliceModal uses),
    - ``items`` has fewer than 2 entries (nothing to substitute).

    The ``0`` guard is load-bearing rather than cosmetic. Plate ids are
    1-indexed, so the geometry lookup for plate 0 matches nothing — but
    the support-filament slots unioned in below come from the project
    config and carry no plate scope at all. Without the guard a slice-all
    of a project with a dedicated support slot would see ``used`` as just
    that one slot, anchor on it, and rewrite every colour in the project
    to the support material (#2711).
